    Session 2A - Internet Fundamentals/Introduction
    Activity 1: "Web Browser Basics," (i completed the chrome step by step activity]
    In this activity, I learned about the key components of a web browser, including the address bar, bookmarks, tabs, and extensions. 
    I also learnt how important it is to customize your browser to your privacy and security choices. I recently got a new macbook and it was very easy to install chrome since it does not have chrome installed.
    This activity helped me with the basic setup.  My present and future environments will both benefit greatly from this just learned knowledge. With the help of this knowledge, I can improve the quality of my online browsing at my current job. 
    If I know how to manage bookmarks and tabs, I can organize and access internet information more efficiently, which will ultimately boost my productivity. Understanding browser security choices will also help me protect important data. 
    This knowledge of the fundamentals of web browsers will be extremely helpful for my future goals.  These abilities will be necessary whether I'm working on a project, doing research, or just browsing the internet. 
    Having a solid understanding of web browser function will also enable me to adapt to any new tools or features that might be introduced in the future as technology continues to advance."

    Activity 1: "insert name of Activity" [What activity did you complete?]
    In this activity, I learned "Safari has this extreme feature "Internet Privacy and Security," This gave me important details on protecting my online identity and data. 
    I gained knowledge on the importance of using strong passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and the need of updating software and hardware to ward off security flaws. 
    In order to apply the ideas from this activity to my current situation, I need to instantly improve my internet security measures.  I'll use secure, one-of-a-kind passwords for all of my accounts, and wherever I can,
    I'll turn on 2FA. With this proactive strategy, the possibility of unwanted access to my personal and professional accounts will be greatly reduced. This information will be even more important in my future environment. 
    Protecting my digital identity and sensitive information will be important as cyber dangers develop further. Understanding internet privacy and security will help me in navigating the digital environment safely and responsibly, 
    whether it is in my personal life or as part of a professional job. A safer online community will result from my use of this knowledge to instruct and help others preserve their online security."
